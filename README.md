# Airbnb-Investment-Project

Intro:
We were tasked with providing a data driven recommendation to a first time Airbnb host. Our targeted host was Sarah, an oncology nurse with a 2 bedroom home in Allston, MA. Sarah is now undergoing a graduate Nursing program in Buffalo, NY and is looking for a recommendation of whether she should rent her home to short-term travelers or longer term tenants. We were tasked with using data from Insideairbnb.com specific to the Boston area, incorporating outside data sources of some kind, and utilizing PowerBI to provide visualizations to support our final recommendation.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122995201/222989408-8a04beaa-c353-422a-b63b-92a592599222.png)


Background:
In order to provide this recommendation to Sarah in a digestible format, we focused on two questions to investigate:

1.	Do short-term Airbnb rentals or long-term lease agreements provide a better ROI within the Boston market?
2.	With that better option in mind, what steps can we recommend taking to maximize the ROI?

As we began aggregating and cleaning the data, and taking into account what we already new about rentals and Airbnb, we hypothesized that Airbnb would provide a much more profitable return on investment as opposed to a longer term lease. We figured that the higher nightly price charged for short term rentals would outweigh the additional expenses associated with furnishing the home and preparing it for regular changeover of guests.

Data Cleaning & Technical Details:
- See Unit1ProjectTechnicalWriteUp.docx

Results:
- When all factors were accounted for, there was a $204/month benefit to pursue short-term leasing. That being said, the $204/month difference is more than made up for by the intangibles:
  - Reduced Time Investment
  - Lower Vacancy Risk
- These amenities were correlated with higher monthly prices on a lease:
  - WiFi
  - Parking
  - In-Unit Laundry 
- Final Recommendation:
  - Long term lease agreement over short-term Airbnb rentals
  - Provide WiFi & Parking in lease to tenants
  - Rent to Boston University students
