# Airbnb-Investment-Project

This is a project completed for my data analytics bootcamp with General Assembly - the goal of the project was to analyze Airbnb listing data in Boston, and recommend to a first time homebuyer whether they should use Airbnb for short-term rentals, or have tenants commit to a longer-term lease.

Please begin by readint the technical write up, and then viewing the slide deck.
